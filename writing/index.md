## [Astraeaâ€™s Liminal Dreams](Astraeas+Liminal+Dreams.html)

- ### Description

For what it's worth, I call this a second draft. I'm not sure if that label is meaningful, because I'm not an editor, nor do I know how to edit. Mostly, I want to convey that this isn't finished, but it's also not a brain dump. I wrote this because I thought it would be fun to enter a small competition. There were only three applicants and it was judged by straw poll. We were tasked with following this prompt loosly: "Amongst the Silver Starlight I find a second chance, in Midsummer Moonlight I am reborn."

- ### Synopis

Astraea finds herself awakening in a hospital room, her senses gradually reconnecting her with reality after a period of intense and vivid dreaming. She struggles with the overlapping memories of her dream world and the actual events leading up to her current state. As her clarity returns, she deciphers that the dream realms were constructs of her subconscious, influenced by the snippets of the waking world around her during her coma.
